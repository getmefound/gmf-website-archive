# AOH Owner Morning Brief Product Research

## Recommendation

Build Mike's version first. Sell the client version as:

> Every morning, you know what happened, what needs attention, and where money may be leaking.

Do not sell "AI agents" first. Sell owner clarity.

The live page is Mike's operating view first:

- Reach/GHL outreach stats are live through the HighLevel read-only email stats API.
- News and market signals are started through Google News RSS feeds.
- Calendar is a custom connector next.
- Email inbox is a custom connector next.
- Archive and proof are live through ledger docs, outbox files, and current CSVs.

## Commercial Brief

This is the standard offer most clients can buy:

- new leads and replies
- campaign/email performance
- missed calls or urgent customer messages
- new reviews and reputation movement
- one market or competitor signal
- one recommended move

## Custom Layer

This is the paid setup layer:

- GHL/CRM pipeline and workflow stats
- email inbox triage
- calendar and booking checks
- Google Business Profile and review response status
- call tracking or missed-call summaries
- ad spend or Stripe/payment summaries

Start read-only. Do not auto-send replies or move meetings without approval.

## Best First Targets

1. Home services
2. Dental, med spa, wellness, chiropractic
3. Local professional services
4. Restaurants/hospitality only where review volume and margins support it
5. Real estate only with tighter compliance controls

## Current AOH Build

- GHL workflow email stats are connected by read-only API.
- Morning Brief now has `Commercial Brief` and `Custom Layer` sections.
- Mission Control page: `/mike-mc/morning-brief`.
- The page is worded for Mike's owner view first, with sales/pricing notes secondary.
- Email and calendar should be the next custom connectors after the internal brief proves useful.
- Daily stats movement will become cleaner after multiple saved daily GHL snapshots exist.

## Retention

- Daily briefs: keep 13 months on the live page.
- Raw proof/log files: keep 90 days.
- Monthly rollups: keep 24 months.
- On cancellation: provide a simple archive export and remove private access.

## Pricing Anchors

- AgencyAnalytics: $20/client/month billed annually.
- DashThis: $44/month annually or $54/month monthly for 3 dashboards.
- Databox: $159/month Pro.
- Whatagraph: 199 euros/month Start, billed annually.

AOH recommended packaging:

- Standard / Commercial Brief: $149-$299/month, with $0-$500 setup.
- Custom Layer: $399-$1,500+/month, with $750-$3,000 setup.

## Sales Positioning

Most reporting tools sell branded dashboards, scheduled reports, client portals, and AI summaries.

AOH should sell the daily owner decision brief first:

> Every morning, you know what happened, what needs attention, and where money may be leaking.

The live page is the proof and archive. The custom layer is only for clients who want private systems connected.
