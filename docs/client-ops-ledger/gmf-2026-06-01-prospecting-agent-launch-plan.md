# GMF 2026-06-01 Prospecting Agent Launch Plan

Status: inspection complete; build in progress
Owner: Manager / Elon
Reviewer: Auditor
Created: 2026-05-29
Target launch: 2026-06-01 mid-morning ET

## Operating Decision

Mike's 2026-05-29 instruction supersedes the older med-spa/dental/home-services launch packet.

Do not launch the paused med-spa seed as-is. The 6/1 prospecting plan targets local businesses where GetMeFound's $149 foundation offer is easier to believe and where the outreach can be personalized from Google Business Profile facts without expensive per-review scraping.

Saturated or excluded for this launch: home services, dental, legal, realtors.

## Inspection Report: Exists Vs Missing

This inspection was completed before writing new prospecting code.

| Area | Exists today | Missing or not launch-ready |
|---|---|---|
| Smartlead access | `npm run smartlead:check` passed. Campaign `3379589` exists and is paused. Three outreach inboxes are connected. | Existing campaign is CT med-spa, one-email seed, not the requested niche/config/4-email system. |
| Smartlead warmup | `npm run smartlead:warmup-report` and `npm run prospecting:preflight` passed on 2026-05-29. Reputations 100, spam 0, max 20/day. | Code should respect Smartlead/account capacity dynamically instead of hardcoded send volume. |
| Sender domains | Three outreach inboxes exist on non-brand domains: `getmefoundnow.com`, `trygetmefound.com`, `getmefoundlocal.com`. | No new inboxes/domains should be added before first healthy send proof. |
| Lead sourcing | `scripts/reach-discovery-first.mjs` uses Outscraper Google Maps search and cost caps. `OUTSCRAPER_API_KEY` is in local `.env.local`. | Config still uses old Reach lanes and old niches. GitHub Actions has no repo secrets, so scheduled discovery cannot run paid Outscraper in Actions yet. |
| Email verification | `scripts/verify-reach-emails.mjs` supports NeverBounce/Hunter. `NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY` is in local `.env.local`. 2026-05-29 account-info check passed with paid credits available. | NoBounce is not configured; Mike approved using the existing NeverBounce verifier for the 6/1 MVP. |
| Lead QA/suppression | SOP 016, SOP 021, old Reach QA scripts, duplicate checks, and seed QA CSV patterns exist. | No central GMF cold-outreach suppression store is wired across Smartlead plus Supabase yet. |
| Segmentation | Older lane scoring exists for reviews/AI/relay. | Missing requested single worst-gap buckets: very few reviews, behind nearby competitor, missing hours/photos, weak AI/search readiness. |
| Copy generation | Old one-email med-spa copy exists. Coach/SOP guardrails exist. | Missing 4-email sequence, subject variants, no-testimonial rule, segment-specific personalization, and final claim audit. |
| Sending | Smartlead schedule/upload script exists for the old hardcoded seed. | Needs new configurable campaign builder and schedule guard that reads warmed inbox capacity and keeps campaign paused until final approval. |
| Reply handling | `lib/campaign-reply-router.ts` and `/api/campaign/reply-router` classify replies. | Current router is GHL/tag-centric and lacks Smartlead webhook/event mapping, OOO class, global opt-out, form-fill stop, and purchase stop. |
| Nurture | SOP 030, SOP 031, SOP 041, SOP 113-116 exist for report delivery, follow-up, nurture, and upgrades. | Post-form-fill/post-report nurture and Get Found to Stay Found upsell are not fully wired as automated event-driven flows. |
| Reporting | Monday, Mission Control, warmup reports, and proof docs exist. | Need segment/niche/subdomain metrics: sends, clicks, replies, form fills, purchases, bounces, complaints, auto-pause reason. |
| Compliance/deliverability | SOP 018, SOP 019, SOP 021, SOP 171 exist. FTC CAN-SPAM requirements checked. Physical mailing address found in prior AOH handoff docs: `13727 SW 152nd St. #1236, Miami, FL 33177`. New read-only Smartlead deliverability audit exists: `npm run smartlead:deliverability-audit`. | Current paused CT med-spa campaign is HOLD for launch because the old sequence lacks the physical address and is the wrong target plan. One-click opt-out and global suppression must be proven before live sends. |

## Launch Go/No-Go

6/1 cold outreach can go live only if these are true before the final send window:

1. New target config replaces the old med-spa/dental/home-services plan.
2. Lead source uses base Outscraper Google Maps data only for the full list.
3. Every sent lead has website, valid verified email, review count below default threshold, and no blank personalization fields.
4. NeverBounce fallback is used for the Monday MVP unless Mike later adds NoBounce.
5. The CAN-SPAM footer uses the prior approved mailing address: `13727 SW 152nd St. #1236, Miami, FL 33177`.
6. Auditor approves copy, suppression, opt-out, reply routing, sender capacity, and final launch packet.
7. Mike gives final live-send approval for the exact campaign, niche, cap, inboxes, send window, and follow-up status.
8. `npm run smartlead:deliverability-audit -- --campaign-id <id>` returns PASS before activation. A WATCH requires Auditor approval; a HOLD blocks launch.

If any item is missing, 6/1 can still launch the organic/requested-report path, but cold outreach stays paused.

## Targeting Config Spec

Default launch geography, unless Mike overrides: Connecticut first, using Greater New Haven/shoreline, Greater Hartford/central CT, and Fairfield County as the initial three regions.

## Testing Strategy

1. Dry-run config parse with no paid API calls.
2. Plan-only Outscraper query count and spend estimate.
3. Paid Outscraper run capped to a tiny sample only after spend gate.
4. Email verification dry run using fixture rows, then live key smoke with 1 internal/test email if key exists.
5. Segmentation fixture tests covering null fields and "single worst gap" selection.
6. Copy generation fixture tests: no blank merge fields, no testimonial/social-proof claims, one CTA, one link, opt-out footer.
7. Smartlead dry-run campaign payload diff, then `npm run smartlead:deliverability-audit -- --campaign-id <id>`. Live campaign must remain paused until approval and audit PASS.
8. Webhook replay tests for replied, opt-out, OOO, hard bounce, form fill, and purchase.
9. Auditor final launch packet review under SOP 018, SOP 019, SOP 021, SOP 171, SOP 187.

## Owner Requirements

Mike is needed for only these items right now:

Resolved:

1. Mike approved using the existing NeverBounce verifier for the 6/1 MVP.
2. Prior mailing address found and recorded for the footer: `13727 SW 152nd St. #1236, Miami, FL 33177`.

Proof: `docs/client-ops-ledger/neverbounce-and-postal-footer-proof-2026-05-29.md`

Still owner-needed later:

1. Final live send approval: after agents produce the candidate list, copy, suppression proof, and Smartlead paused campaign packet, approve or hold the exact send.

Everything else is agent-owned.
