# Daily Agent Brief

Date: 2026-05-21
Prepared by: Manager

## 1. Needs Mike Today

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Risk | Approval needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Normal Reach warmup | Auto mode is on. Reviews and AI Visibility started today. Relay used today's capped refill and will rotate to the next searches on the next run. | Relay only has 5 OK contacts and is not marked ready | No Mike action unless overriding auto |

## 2. Campaigns Being Prepared

| Campaign | Lane | Audience | Verified contacts from May 19 | Budget cap | Current status |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Reviews | `reviews` | Pet boarding / Connecticut | 12 OK started | $2 | Auto warmup start executed |
| AI Visibility | `ai` | Senior living / Connecticut | 20 OK started | $2 | Auto warmup start executed |
| Relay | `relay` | Veterinary / Connecticut | 5 OK / 10 min | $2 | Auto waiting; today's 60-record refill cap used |

## 3. Required Checks Before Any Live Action

| Check | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Confirm Reviews sending subdomain and daily send limit | GHL Expert | Waiting |
| Confirm AI Visibility sending subdomain and daily send limit | GHL Expert | Waiting |
| Confirm Relay sending subdomain and daily send limit | GHL Expert | Mike visually confirmed for import-only approval. Drip readiness still no |
| Confirm each start tag triggers only intended workflow | GHL Expert | API metadata passed; visual sender-domain check still required |
| Confirm no HighLevel AI feature is enabled | GHL Expert | Mike visually confirmed OFF for Relay import-only approval. Required again before start-drip |
| Generate approval packet per lane | Manager | Ready after preflight |
| Review personal email / duplicate-contact QA flags | Sales Manager | Relay resolved: 2 OK imported and 2 flagged rows held. Reviews and AI still waiting |

## 4. Fresh Prep Results

| Lane | Raw | Fresh after history/state filter | Verified | QA rows needing review | Approval packet |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Reviews | 25 | 19 | 8 | 7 | `docs/client-ops-ledger/outbox/reach-reviews-approval-2026-05-20.md` |
| AI Visibility | 25 | 20 | 6 | 5 | `docs/client-ops-ledger/outbox/reach-ai-approval-2026-05-20.md` |
| Relay | 25 | 7 | 4 | 2 | 2 QA OK rows imported-only; 2 flagged rows held |

## 5. Tag Safety

| Lane | Import-only tags | Start-drip tags |
|---|---|---|
| Reviews | `aoh_campaign_reviews` + `aoh_campaign_reviews_imported` | `aoh_campaign_reviews` + `aoh_campaign_reviews_start` |
| AI Visibility | `aoh_campaign_ai_visibility` + `aoh_campaign_ai_imported` | `aoh_campaign_ai_visibility` + `aoh_campaign_ai_visibility_start` |
| Relay | `aoh_campaign_relay` + `aoh_campaign_relay_imported` | `aoh_campaign_relay` + `aoh_campaign_relay_start` |

## 6. Recommendation

Do not manually override auto.

Recommended path:

1. Let auto continue for Reviews and AI Visibility.
2. Let the next auto run rotate Relay into the next searches until it has at least 10 OK contacts.
3. Mark Relay `ready_for_drip=yes` only after the sending setup is checked.
4. Auto will start Relay when both conditions are true.
5. Keep HighLevel AI features OFF.

Current picture: Reviews and AI started today. Relay is the only holdout.

## 7. Fresh Batch Prep Commands

Normal daily run is auto:

```bash
npm run reach:warmup -- --lane all --execute auto
```

Prep commands below are for manual research or rebuilding a lane.

Single-command prep:

```bash
npm run reach:prep -- --lane reviews --industry "pet boarding" --area "Connecticut" --state "Connecticut" --limit 25
```

Manual sequence:

```bash
npm run reach:launch -- --lane reviews --industry "pet boarding" --area "Connecticut" --limit 25 --out tmp-reach-reviews-next.json
npm run reach:csv -- --input tmp-reach-reviews-next.json --out tmp-reach-reviews-next-clean.csv
npm run reach:fresh -- --lane reviews --csv tmp-reach-reviews-next-clean.csv --out tmp-reach-reviews-next-fresh.csv --state "Connecticut"
npm run reach:verify -- --csv tmp-reach-reviews-next-fresh.csv --out tmp-reach-reviews-next-verified.csv
npm run reach:preflight -- --lane reviews --csv tmp-reach-reviews-next-verified.csv --report tmp-reach-reviews-next-verified-report.json
```

Repeat with `ai` / senior living and `relay` / veterinary after confirming the lane priority.

## 8. Manual Override Commands

```text
approve reviews import only
approve reviews start drip
approve ai import only
approve ai start drip
approve relay import only
approve relay start drip
pause all campaign live actions
```

## 9. Agent Command Surface

Wired locally today:

```bash
npm run agent:brief
npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, status"
npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, list agents"
npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, owner peek"
npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, train Reach team"
npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, run Reach Cold Email Campaign"
npm run agent:command -- --command "GHL Expert, check Reach readiness"
npm run agent:command -- --command "Sales Manager, review Reach QA"
```

Slack posting is env-gated through `SLACK_MISSION_CONTROL_WEBHOOK_URL` or `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

Default command channel: `#04-aoh-ops`.

Default daily campaign command: `Manager, run Reach Cold Email Campaign`.

Slack HTTP listener endpoint: `/api/agent/slack`.

Direct agent addressing is now expected in Slack, for example `Coach, review this copy` or `Reporter, verify report delivery status`.

Agents recognize Mike by Slack user ID and answer first-name by default. Add `formal` to a command when a formal response is wanted.

Slack speed mode is now expected: fast commands answer from the ledger/brief, while slower GHL or Reach checks acknowledge first and post the full result as a follow-up. Say `fresh` or `live` when a cached GHL readiness result is not acceptable.

The scheduled Reach Warmup Autopilot can import/start ready lanes inside guardrails. Manual overrides still need the live execution guard.
