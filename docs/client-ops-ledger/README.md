# AOH Client Ops Ledger

This folder contains the v1 operating ledger for running AOH clients with agents.

The ledger is intentionally spreadsheet-first. Mike should be able to open it, scan every client, and know:

- who the client is
- what service plan they are on
- where their data lives
- which agents are assigned
- what happened most recently
- what needs a human decision
- whether the account is healthy, stuck, or at risk

## Files

| `sending-domain-readiness-checklist.md` | GHL Expert signoff checklist before approving start-drip. |

## Recommended Workflow

1. Keep `client-ops-ledger.csv` as the human-readable source of truth until AOH has enough clients to justify Postgres.
2. Create one Obsidian client profile note per paying client using `client-profile-template.md`.
3. Give every client a stable `client_id` before any agent touches the account.
4. Require all agent runs to write back to the ledger through a controlled workflow, not by freeform editing.
5. Route every agent job through `agent-model-routing-policy.md` so cheap/no-LLM steps stay cheap.
6. Use `reach-campaign-agent-runbook.md` before any agent prepares, imports, or starts a Reach email campaign.
7. Use `slack-agent-command-runbook.md` and `npm run agent:brief` for Mike-facing briefs and approval commands.
8. Move to a real database only after the spreadsheet becomes painful, likely around 15-25 active clients.

## Higher-Level Truth

Before building more client ops automation, read `aoh-agent-company-operating-model.md`. The ledger is one part of a larger company operating model:

Mike reviews and approves. Secretary prepares the brief. Manager scans the company. Specialist agents investigate. Approved recommendations become jobs. Completed jobs update the ledger and client profiles.

For outreach campaigns, the extra rule is:

> Agents may research, clean, verify, and prepare. Mike must explicitly approve GHL imports and drip starts.
