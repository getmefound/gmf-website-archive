# Morning Brief Skill Pack

Status: v1 owner brief design
Owner: General Manager
Last updated: 2026-05-21

## Purpose

The Morning Brief gives Mike the owner view before the day starts:

1. What happened yesterday.
2. What needs Mike today.
3. What agents are handling.
4. What changed in the market.
5. The one best move for the day.

This starts as an internal AOH brief for Mike. After it proves useful for a few weeks, package it as a client offer.

## Agent Ownership

| Agent | Owns |
|---|---|
| General Manager | Final brief, priority order, owner language, decisions, blockers. |
| GHL Expert | GHL campaign stats, workflows, pipeline proof, export/readiness checks. |
| Sales Manager | What the campaign numbers mean and what to do next. |
| Scout / Market Watcher | Industry news, competitor signals, niche opportunities, offer ideas. |
| Systems Director | Cron reliability, source health, cost, failed jobs, missing data. |

General Manager sends the final brief. Specialist agents feed the brief.

## Current Knowledge Method

Current agent commands read known local files:

- `docs/client-ops-ledger/daily-brief-current.md`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/morning-brief-current.md`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/morning-brief-sources.json`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/agent-jobs.csv`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/sending-domain-readiness.csv`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/outbox/*`

This is reliable for operating status, but it is not a full searchable knowledge base.

## Knowledge Upgrade Path

Use three layers:

1. **Local operating files** for fast facts and job status.
2. **Live APIs/exports** for numbers that change, such as GHL campaign stats.
3. **Retrieval knowledge base** for broad documentation, such as HighLevel docs and playbooks.

Do not paste all GHL documentation into every prompt. Ingest it into a searchable knowledge base, attach source URLs, and retrieve only the relevant passages.

## Recommended Retrieval Design

For AOH v1, use OpenAI hosted file search or a small local retrieval layer.

OpenAI hosted file search:

- best when we want faster setup and less infrastructure
- supports vector stores, filters, result limits, and source results
- good for markdown docs, runbooks, and selected GHL help articles

Self-managed retrieval, such as Qdrant or Postgres/pgvector:

- best when we need more control over chunking, hybrid search, reranking, or metadata
- more work to maintain
- useful later if client knowledge bases grow

## Source Rules

| Topic | Source priority |
|---|---|
| OpenAI/agent build | Official OpenAI docs first. |
| GHL API/platform facts | Official HighLevel developer docs and support docs first. |
| GHL real-world gotchas | Trusted implementation forums second, clearly marked as practitioner signal. |
| Morning news | Google Alerts/RSS first, then curated industry sources. |
| Campaign results | GHL stats/export or read-only API proof, not screenshots alone. |

Forums are useful for edge cases, but they do not override official docs or live system proof.

## Current Build

The v1 generator is:

```bash
npm run morning:brief
```

It writes:

- `docs/client-ops-ledger/morning-brief-current.md`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/outbox/morning-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Optional flags:

```bash
npm run morning:brief -- --date 2026-05-21
npm run morning:brief -- --fetch-news
npm run morning:brief -- --post-slack
```

Current connected data:

- Reach job ledger
- sending domain readiness
- Reach warmup reports
- GHL import/start result files
- optional GHL email stats CSV
- optional Google Alerts/RSS feed URLs

The expected GHL stats shape is in `docs/client-ops-ledger/ghl-email-stats-template.csv`.

## Owner Brief Shape

```text
Morning Brief - YYYY-MM-DD

1. Overnight result
- Reach: sent/delivered/opened/replied/bounced if available.
- Leads: new clean contacts found.
- Replies: hot replies, opt-outs, unclear replies.

2. Needs Mike today
- Approval, spend change, target change, or client-facing risk only.

3. Agents working
- GHL Expert: campaign stats and GHL proof.
- Sales Manager: what the numbers mean.
- Scout: news/opportunity signals.
- Systems Director: cron/source failures.

4. Market signal
- One useful industry/news item and why it matters.

5. Recommended move
- One clear action.
```
