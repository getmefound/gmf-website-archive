# Prospecting Core Setup Memory

Status: active owner preference
Owner: Manager
Recorded: 2026-05-27

## Mike's Direction

Mike wants the core prospecting operating setup built before campaign work continues.

The operating model is:

- agents run the jobs
- Manager only contacts Mike when human involvement is required
- Slack is for human-needed alerts and on-demand questions
- Monday is the close-monitoring work board
- Mission Control is the owner report surface
- Langfuse is the agent trace/debug layer
- Smartlead is the send/deliverability system

Do not treat chat history as the only source of truth. This file, the prospecting operating plan, the agent job queue, and the Monday-ready seed file are the durable memory for this setup.

## Core Setup Order

1. Create/confirm Monday structure for prospecting jobs. Done: live board `Agents Jobs`, board ID `18415045648`.
2. Add the first human-needed job: refresh Smartlead API access. Done: item ID `12115656169`.
3. Store Smartlead API access locally and in production only after Mike provides/authorizes it.
4. Re-run `npm run prospecting:preflight`.
5. If preflight passes, let agents proceed to target/list/copy/seed-test planning.
6. If preflight fails, Manager reports only the human-needed blocker.

## Manager Contact Rule

Manager may contact Mike only for:

- approval before live prospect or client action
- spend or cap increase
- broken account/API access
- legal, billing, deliverability, reputation, or customer-facing risk
- a blocker agents cannot clear themselves

Routine progress should go to Monday, Mission Control, proof files, or on-demand Slack.

## First Human Job

Title: Refresh Smartlead API access

Why human is needed: Smartlead account/API access is controlled by Mike. Agents cannot safely create or rotate account credentials without owner authorization.

Proof required before done:

- new Smartlead API key exists in the secure store
- local `.env.local` has `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY`
- Vercel production has `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY`
- `npm run prospecting:preflight` passes or shows a new non-access blocker

## Live Monday Status

Live Monday write is connected locally through `MONDAY_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.

Live board:

- Name: Agents Jobs
- Board ID: `18415045648`

First live item:

- Name: Refresh Smartlead API access
- Item ID: `12115656169`
- Group: Human Needed

Current core setup items:

- Refresh Smartlead API access: `12115656169`, Human Needed
- Connect Monday API to agents: `12115707896`, Done
- Build prospecting Mission Control reports: `12115719355`, Agent Working

Fallback records:

- `docs/client-ops-ledger/monday-prospecting-core-setup-import.csv`
- `docs/client-ops-ledger/agent-jobs.csv`

Do not expose the raw Monday token to agents. Manager, Systems Director, and Reporter may write to Monday only through:

```bash
npm run monday:agent-job
```

or a future approved internal endpoint.

Other agents must route owner-visible updates through Manager.
