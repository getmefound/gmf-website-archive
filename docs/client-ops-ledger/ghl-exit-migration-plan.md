# GHL Exit Migration Plan

Status: planning v1  
Owner: Manager  
Specialists: Systems Director, GHL Expert, Website/Codex, Sender, Auditor  
Last updated: 2026-05-21

## Plain-English Decision

AOH should move off GHL as the operating backbone.

GHL becomes a short bridge:

1. Downgrade to the $97 plan if support confirms data/workflows/API access will
   remain intact.
2. Do not build new AOH services around GHL.
3. Export and document current GHL assets.
4. Rebuild Review Automation, AI Visibility, Reach, and reports outside GHL.
5. Cancel GHL only after live replacement checks pass.

## Why Not Cancel Immediately

GHL is still being used for:

- active Reach cold email campaigns
- campaign drip workflow starts
- contact import/tagging
- campaign reply routing
- email campaign stats
- website report handoff pieces
- workflow proof while the replacement is being built

Canceling before these are replaced risks losing campaign history, workflow
settings, contacts, and proof.

## Downgrade Rule

Downgrade target:

- $97 Starter plan

Before approving the downgrade, confirm with GHL support:

- contacts stay intact
- workflows stay intact
- calendars stay intact
- email stats/history remain visible
- custom fields/values stay intact
- pipelines stay intact
- API keys/access still work enough for export and transition
- existing automations do not stop because of a plan gate
- upgrade-back path is available if something breaks

Do not tell support the cancellation plan. The immediate ask is only:

> I am reducing cost. What breaks if I move from $497 to $97?

## GHL Freeze Rules

After downgrade:

- no new client subaccounts
- no GHL SaaS Mode work
- no GHL AI Employee
- no Search Atlas/SEO/heatmap add-ons
- no Premium Prospecting add-on
- no new paid GHL feature unless Mike manually approves
- no client-facing promise that depends on a GHL-only feature
- no new GHL calendar or booking dependency

GHL is allowed only for:

- keeping current Reach workflows alive while migration is underway
- exporting settings/history
- training GHL Expert on how to translate automations into AOH-owned systems

## Calendar Decision

Do not migrate or rebuild the old GHL calendars.

AOH should use a new booking tool:

- Calendly for the main AOH booking system
- Google Calendar underneath as the actual calendar source

Start with Calendly for:

- sales calls
- Review Automation setup calls
- AI Visibility strategy calls
- client check-ins

Use Calendly Standard while Mike is the main bookable person. Upgrade to a
team/routing plan only when AOH needs round-robin, routing, or multiple sales
or setup calendars.

GHL calendar data should be archived only. It is not a migration target.

## Replacement Workstreams

| Workstream | Replacement target | Exit gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Review Automation | AOH client page, database, review email sender, private feedback page, monthly recap | AOH can run review requests for AOH and 1 pilot client without GHL. |
| AI Visibility | AOH client page, GBP checklist, AI scans, heatmap vendor/API, AI reply drafts, monthly report | AOH can produce one AI Visibility report without GHL/Search Atlas. |
| Reach cold email | Smartlead or Instantly for sending/drips, AOH for sourcing/scoring/reporting | New campaign can send, stop on reply, track stats, and report without GHL. |
| Report routing | AOH database/API tracks report requests and ready state | Website report request no longer needs GHL workflow state. |
| Email stats | Email provider/API stats feed AOH brief | Morning brief can show campaign stats without GHL email stats. |
| Relay | Partner/reseller voice AI platform | Relay does not require GHL subaccounts or GHL phone workflows. |
| Data/archive | Export GHL contacts, workflows, fields, tags, stats, assets | Auditor can find old proof after GHL is canceled. |

## Build Order

### Step 1: GHL Inventory And Export

Owner: GHL Expert  
Reviewer: Auditor

Repeatable command:

```bash
npm run ghl:exit-inventory
```

This creates a dated, read-only metadata inventory in
`docs/client-ops-ledger/outbox/`. It does not export contacts, customer records,
message bodies, token values, passwords, or HighLevel AI settings.

Current 2026-05-21 inventory snapshot:

- 1 GHL location
- 6 pipelines
- 167 workflows
- 191 custom fields
- 91 custom values
- 10 email workflow campaigns
- 8 calendars
- 228 tags

Export or document:

- active locations/subaccounts
- contacts and tags
- workflows and triggers
- custom fields and custom values
- pipelines and stages
- email templates
- campaign stats
- active booking links only as references; do not rebuild GHL calendars
- report workflow names and callback paths
- wallet/add-ons/current billable features

Done means:

- there is a dated export folder or doc
- no secret values are printed in docs
- Manager knows what still depends on GHL

Contact/customer exports, if needed later, must go to a gitignored folder such
as `data/ghl-exit/YYYY-MM-DD/` and must not be committed.

### Step 2: AOH Review Automation Core

Owner: Website/Codex  
Specialists: Sender, Sorter, Local Visibility Manager, Manager

Build:

- client record
- client page
- intake/customer upload
- do-not-contact list
- Google review link field
- private feedback page
- review request email template
- send log
- one follow-up rule
- monthly recap

Done means:

- AOH can send its own review request test outside GHL
- low-rating feedback routes privately
- happy feedback reaches Google review link
- send log and client page update correctly

Current v1 foundation:

- `/client/[slug]/customers` accepts customer/job rows and applies basic
  missing-email, duplicate, and do-not-contact holds.
- `/api/review-automation/customers` forwards full packets only to the AOH-owned
  review automation webhook when configured; Slack gets summary counts.
- `/review/[slug]` collects private feedback before Google.
- `/api/review-automation/feedback` routes 1-3 star feedback privately and only
  sends 4-5 star customers to Google when a verified review link exists.

### Step 3: AOH AI Visibility Core

Owner: Local Visibility Manager  
Specialists: Scout, Reporter, Website/Codex, Auditor

Build:

- AI visibility prompt scan checklist
- GBP/profile health checklist
- heatmap vendor/API test
- AI reply draft workflow
- monthly visibility report page
- upgrade-only SMS plan using Twilio

Done means:

- one AOH AI Visibility report can be generated outside GHL
- heatmap/ranking source is not GHL/Search Atlas
- reply drafts require approval before publishing

### Step 4: Reach Migration

Owner: Sender  
Specialists: Scout, Sales Manager, Systems Director, Auditor

Target stack:

- Outscraper/business discovery for leads
- NeverBounce or similar for verification
- Smartlead or Instantly for drip sending
- AOH database for prospects/status
- AOH reply classifier for `send`, `book`, interested, not interested,
  unsubscribe
- AOH/Slack for Manager reporting

Done means:

- one small campaign runs outside GHL
- drip stops on reply
- unsubscribe works
- bounces are visible
- reply routing works
- Manager brief shows stats without GHL

### Step 5: Report Flow Migration

Owner: Website/Codex  
Specialists: Reporter, Auditor

Build:

- report request table
- report status table
- generated report URL storage
- heatmap URL storage
- callback or direct update path
- client/prospect-facing report delivery

Done means:

- website report request can complete without GHL workflow state
- Reporter can open generated links
- Auditor can prove no duplicate sends

### Step 6: Cancel GHL

Owner: Systems Director  
Approver: Mike

Cancel only when:

- no live Reach campaign depends on GHL
- no client Review Automation setup depends on GHL
- no AI Visibility reporting depends on GHL/Search Atlas
- contacts/workflows/stats have been exported
- replacement stack has run successfully for at least 30 days or Mike approves
  an earlier exit
- Manager can answer "what breaks if GHL is off?" with "nothing client-facing"

## Agent Training Plan

Yes, agents should be involved.

This migration is a training opportunity because every GHL function becomes an
AOH-owned operating skill.

| Agent | Training focus | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager | Route GHL-exit work, track blockers, brief Mike simply | Manager becomes the right-hand operator instead of Mike babysitting. |
| Systems Director | Cost, vendor choices, cron jobs, failure alerts, downgrade/cancel gates | Keeps the replacement lean and reliable. |
| GHL Expert | Export GHL assets, translate workflows into AOH specs, inspect what breaks on downgrade | GHL knowledge becomes sellable automation knowledge, not dependency. |
| Website/Codex | Build AOH client pages, APIs, database, cron, logs | This is the new core platform. |
| Sender | Move drips from GHL to Smartlead/Instantly/AOH logic | Reach cannot leave GHL without Sender owning this. |
| Scout | Research vendors, costs, heatmap tools, cold email tools, voice partners | Prevents expensive tool choices. |
| Sorter | Customer/prospect list cleanup and suppression rules | Bad lists break review automation and outreach. |
| Local Visibility Manager | GBP access, profile checks, review link, AI Visibility findings | Replaces GHL reputation dependence. |
| Reporter | Monthly reports, heatmap/visibility summaries, result pages | Makes the service feel premium without GHL dashboards. |
| Auditor | QA, proof, downgrade safety, cancellation readiness | Prevents silent breakage. |

GHL Expert should not disappear. The role changes:

- from "operate GHL forever"
- to "understand GHL well enough to export, replace, and sell automation
  services to clients who still use GHL"

## Owner View

Mike should only need to see:

- GHL plan: $97 bridge / downgrade confirmed / cancel ready
- Replacement status: Review, AI Visibility, Reach, Reports
- Current blocker
- Next safest action
- Monthly cost avoided

Manager command:

```text
Manager, GHL exit status
```
