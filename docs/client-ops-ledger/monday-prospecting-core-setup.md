## Item #1

Item: Refresh Smartlead API access

Group: Human Needed

Status: Human Needed

Owner: Mike

Priority: High

Due Date: 2026-05-27

Human Needed: Yes

System: Smartlead

Proof Link: `docs/client-ops-ledger/prospecting-smartlead-preflight-current.md`

Next Action: Generate/confirm a valid Smartlead API key, store it securely, add it locally and in Vercel production, then re-run `npm run prospecting:preflight`.

Notes: This is the first prospecting job because live Smartlead sends must not run until API access and warmup readiness are proven.

## Current Integration Status

No Monday connector or `MONDAY_API_TOKEN` is available in this workspace yet, so the live Monday item has not been created through API. The import-ready row is saved in `docs/client-ops-ledger/monday-prospecting-core-setup-import.csv`.
