Item: Refresh Smartlead API access

Live item ID: `12115656169`

Group: Human Needed

Status: Human Needed

Owner: Mike

Priority: High

Due Date: 2026-05-27

Human Needed: Yes

System: Smartlead

Proof Link: `docs/client-ops-ledger/prospecting-smartlead-preflight-current.md`

Next Action: Generate/confirm a valid Smartlead API key, store it securely, add it locally and in Vercel production, then re-run `npm run prospecting:preflight`.

Notes: This is the first prospecting job because live Smartlead sends must not run until API access and warmup readiness are proven.

## Current Integration Status

`MONDAY_API_TOKEN` is configured locally in `.env.local` and was used to create the live `Agents Jobs` board and the first human-needed job.

The token is not committed to git. Agents must use an approved local script or internal endpoint to write to Monday rather than carrying the raw token in prompts or notes.

Approved local writer:

```bash
npm run monday:agent-job
```

Allowed writer roles:

- Manager
- Systems Director
- Reporter

Scout, Sender, Coach, Sorter, Booker, and other specialist agents must report through Manager or a controlled workflow. They should not carry `MONDAY_API_TOKEN`.

Verified behavior:

- `Manager` can create/update items.
- `Reporter` can create/update items.
- `Scout` is blocked from writing directly.

The import-ready row remains saved in `docs/client-ops-ledger/monday-prospecting-core-setup-import.csv` as fallback documentation.

## Script Examples

List visible jobs:

```bash
npm run monday:agent-job -- --action list
```

Ensure groups and columns exist:

```bash
npm run monday:agent-job -- --action setup --role Manager
```

Create or update the first human-needed item:

```bash
npm run monday:agent-job -- --action create --role Manager --name "Refresh Smartlead API access" --group "Human Needed" --status "Human Needed" --owner Mike --agent-owner "Manager / Systems Director" --system Smartlead --human-needed yes --priority High --due 2026-05-27 --budget 0 --proof "https://github.com/mje-gmf/website/blob/main/docs/client-ops-ledger/prospecting-smartlead-preflight-current.md" --proof-text "Smartlead preflight report" --next-action "Refresh the Smartlead API key, add it locally and in production, then rerun npm run prospecting:preflight." --upsert
```
