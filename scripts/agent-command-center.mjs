Yes. The team should handle the recurring work.

Codex role:

- Codex trains and repairs the system; agents run recurring work inside guardrails.
- Train and repair the system.
- Improve guardrails, costs, workflows, and Mission Control.
- Step in when automation breaks or a new job type needs setup.

Agent ownership:

- Manager: daily control, plain-English status, blocker assignment, and Mike-facing decisions.
- Scout: business discovery, better niches, rotating weak searches, and avoiding repeated poor scrape spend.
- Sender + verifier: email verification and clean selected CSVs before GHL action.
- Sales Manager: list quality, offer fit, row-level keep/hold judgment, and lane priority.
- GHL Expert: sender domains, workflow sender nodes, tags, warmup status, and HighLevel AI toggles OFF.
- Systems Director: cron health, GitHub workflows, credentials, caps, costs, and same-day rerun safety.
- Sorter: classify replies when replies arrive.
- Booker: move interested replies toward the calendar.

Training status:

- Reviews and AI Visibility are running under auto.
- Relay is waiting because it has 5 OK contacts and needs 10.
- The next auto run rotates Relay into the next searches instead of repeating the same first searches.
- Same-day reruns preserve executed reports instead of overwriting the ledger.
- Safety: HighLevel AI features stay OFF.

Next team command:

\`\`\`text
Manager, run Reach Cold Email Campaign

function buildOwnerPeekResponse() {
  return {

    text: `*Manager owner peek - ${today()}*

Short answer: you do not need to read every agent conversation.

Where to look:

- *Manager conversation*: Slack #04-aoh-ops is where you talk to Manager and see brief answers, blockers, and follow-ups.
- *Mission Control front page*: owner view of active jobs, blockers, agents, and spend.
- *Reach job room*: cold email lane status, agent handoff, and next blocker.
- *GitHub/ledger/outbox*: proof logs only; use these when something looks wrong.

DM status:

- Automatic Manager DMs are not wired yet.
- Recommended DM policy: one short daily DM plus urgent exceptions only.
- Do not DM every agent action; that becomes noise fast.

What I would expect Manager to send you:

\`\`\`text
Reach today: Reviews and AI running. Relay needs 5 more clean contacts. No action needed from Mike unless raising spend or overriding safety.
\`\`\`

Next useful command:

\`\`\`text
Manager, status

Current position:

- ${reachJobs.length} Reach prep jobs are in the queue; ${waiting} are waiting on agent review.
- The scheduled auto runner owns normal import/start work inside guardrails; this command center explains and routes blockers.
- GHL Expert API metadata has passed for all three lanes; visual sender/domain/warmup and HighLevel AI OFF checks still remain.
- Default Slack command channel is \`#04-aoh-ops\`.
- Slack webhook posting is ${webhookReady ? "configured" : "not configured in env yet"}; this brief is written locally either way.

Reach queue:

${summaries.map(renderLaneBullet).join("\n")}

Agent gates before live action:

- Sales Manager: review personal email and duplicate-contact QA flags.
- GHL Expert: visually confirm sender/from domain, warmup status, workflow sender nodes, and HighLevel AI toggles OFF.
- Manager: regenerate/confirm the approval packet for the final CSV.
- Mike: approve only exceptions, cap increases, or manual overrides. Normal auto can start after readiness is proven.

Mike, here is the owner version.

Overnight result:

- Reach: ${relayLine}
- Current lanes: ${summaries.map((summary) => `${summary.label} ${summary.status}`).join("; ")}.
- Safety: GHL Expert still owns sender/domain proof, and HighLevel AI stays OFF.

Needs Mike today:

- No routine babysitting. Manager should bring you only spend changes, safety overrides, target changes, or stuck client-facing risk.

Who feeds the brief:

- GHL Expert: GHL campaign numbers, workflow proof, and exports.
- Sales Manager: what the numbers mean and what to do next.
- Scout / Market Watcher: industry news, competitor signals, and offer ideas.
- Local Visibility Manager: GBP access/update status and local visibility findings.
- Systems Director: cron/source failures and cost risk.
- Manager: final owner summary to you.

Market/news:

- Not fully wired yet. First source layer should be Google Alerts/RSS plus curated industry sources; broad GHL/docs knowledge should use retrieval, not one giant prompt.

Recommended move:

${dailySignals.recommendation || "Keep auto on. Let agents handle routine refills and readiness; bring Mike only exceptions or true business decisions."}

Knowledge note:

- Today the agents read local ledgers/runbooks and run scoped checks. The Morning Brief skill pack now records the upgrade path for a searchable GHL/document knowledge base.`,

Mike, here is the simple owner version.

- *No LLM*: CSV parsing, dedupe, counts, API checks, imports, scheduled jobs.
- *Cheap model*: bulk summaries, obvious fit checks, simple reply labels, first-pass news scan. Gemini Flash is the preferred cheap lane now that the Production key is configured.
- *Standard model*: campaign angles, reply triage, sales judgment, and morning brief synthesis.
- *Strong model*: production code, complex GHL risk, approval packets, sensitive client-facing decisions.
- *Human*: spend changes, drip starts, live prospect/client action, and any HighLevel AI feature.

Current runtime key check:

- ${geminiStatus}
- ${openAiStatus}
- ${anthropicStatus}
- Vercel also has GHL, Slack, Outscraper, cron, and OpenClaw keys.

Mike, Local Visibility Manager status:

Access:

- Confirmed for the AOH client-zero test.
- AOH's own Google Business Profile is the practice account.

Profile gaps:

- Not fully inspected from Slack yet.
- Local Visibility Manager owns the visual check: hours, services, categories, photos, posts, review link, and unanswered reviews.
- Automation gap: the Slack listener cannot open Mike's authenticated Google profile by itself yet.

Agent-prepared draft:

AI Outsource Hub helps local businesses automate the follow-up work that usually falls through the cracks: review requests, lead outreach, missed-call response, and client updates. The goal is simple: help owners stay visible, respond faster, and grow without adding more admin work.

Proof needed:

- Screenshot of People and access showing AOH access.
- Screenshot of the profile edit area before any public change.
- Screenshot of the final preview before publishing.

Manager recommendation:

- This draft is safe to use as the first AOH GBP post.
- Agent team should prepare the post and proof.
- Mike should only be asked for the final public-publish decision.
- Nothing gets published until Mike says exactly: \`publish GBP post\`.

Client rule for later:

- For clients, use the business-domain Google login as the invite email for now.
- The business owner adds that email under Business Profile settings -> People and access.
- Default access is Manager, not Owner.
- No password sharing.

Handoff:

- Manager tracks blockers and puts them in the brief.
- GHL Expert helps only if GBP needs to connect into HighLevel/reputation workflows.

This is *not* a Reach drip approval.

Final post:

AI Outsource Hub helps local businesses automate the follow-up work that usually falls through the cracks: review requests, lead outreach, missed-call response, and client updates. The goal is simple: help owners stay visible, respond faster, and grow without adding more admin work.

Agent work:

- Local Visibility Manager prepares the GBP post.
- Press captures proof screenshots.
- Manager reports final status back to Mike.

Proof checklist:

- People and access screenshot already shows AOH control.
- Screenshot before publishing.
- Screenshot after Google accepts/submits the post.
- Note whether Google says the post is pending review.

Only final owner gate:

- Public publishing still needs Mike to say exactly: \`publish GBP post\`.

Safety:

- Do not publish from Slack.
- Do not start any Reach drip.
- Do not enable any HighLevel AI feature.

Short version: auto is on. Ready lanes can start; unready lanes wait.

What this means:

- ${summaries.length} Reach lanes are staged; ${waiting} still need Sales Manager QA and visual GHL review.
- ${importReady} lanes are marked import-ready, but import-only does not send emails.
- ${dripReady} lanes are marked drip-ready; auto can start those lanes when guardrails pass.
- The read-only GHL API check can pass while visual checks are still open.

Current best move:

${bestMove}

Recommended next commands:

Do not manually override auto unless there is a reason.

Safety:

- ${relayImportCompleted ? "Relay import-only already imported/tagged the 2 QA OK contacts. This check imported no new contacts." : "No contacts were imported."}
- No drip was started.

What Manager owns:

- Work toward today's warmup amount without asking Mike to decide each row.
- Reuse already-paid scrape inventory before making a new Outscraper call.
- Replace bad, risky, duplicate, personal-domain, unknown, or catchall emails.
- Expand the search if the first niche or area is too small.
- Import only QA OK contacts when the lane is import-ready.
- Start drip only when the lane is marked \`ready_for_drip=yes\`.
- If a lane is short, refill it with capped discovery before trying to start drip.
- Stop at the configured attempt and scrape caps so this cannot loop forever.
- New Outscraper calls can run inside the caps because Mike approved auto.

Current lanes:

Behind-the-scenes runner:

Safety:

- HighLevel AI features stay OFF.
- Auto can start lanes after \`ready_for_drip=yes\` and guardrails pass.

Manager ran today's active Reach Cold Email Campaign routine.

What ran:

- Sales Manager QA summary from the current verified CSVs.
- GHL Expert read-only readiness check.
- Manager approval gate review.

GHL Expert result: ${ghlResult.ok ? "read-only API check passed" : "read-only API check failed"}

Current lanes:

${summaries.map(renderLaneBullet).join("\n")}

What still needs work:

- Auto warmup is on for lanes that pass guardrails.
- Relay needs enough clean contacts and \`ready_for_drip=yes\`.
- HighLevel AI toggles must stay OFF.

${nextApprovalText}

Do not manually override auto.

Safety:

- ${relayImportCompleted ? "Relay import-only already imported/tagged the 2 QA OK contacts. This check imported no new contacts." : "No contacts were imported."}
- No drip was started.
- No GHL workflows or settings were changed.
- No HighLevel AI features were enabled or toggled.

Plain-English recommendation:

${dailySignals.recommendation || "Reviews and AI can run through auto. Relay is the holdout until it has 10 OK contacts and ready_for_drip=yes."}

Current position:

- ${waiting} lanes are still waiting on Sales Manager QA and visual GHL review.
- The scheduled auto runner owns normal import/start work inside guardrails.
- This status command did not take live action or run a fresh GHL API check.

Short answer: ${autoOn ? "yes, auto is set." : "no, auto is not turned on in the ledger."}

- Runs: discovery/refill around 7:30 AM ET on weekdays; send check around 9:00 AM ET daily; Manager recovery check around 9:20 AM ET.

    text: `*GHL exit status - ${today()}*

Short answer: use GHL $97 as the cheapest bridge while the replacement proves itself.

Current job:

- Status: ${job?.status || "not logged"}
- Owner: ${job?.owner_agent || "Manager"}
- Next: ${job?.next_action || "Run the read-only inventory, then assign export and replacement owners."}

Current GHL footprint:

- ${counts || "Run `npm run ghl:exit-inventory` to refresh the footprint."}

What changed today:

- GHL Expert has a read-only exit inventory command.
- GHL readiness rechecks now preserve prior start-drip approvals instead of resetting them.
- Reviews and AI Visibility stay drip-ready; Relay still waits until its clean-list gate clears.
- Calendly, Smartlead/Instantly, and a separate review email sender are deferred unless GHL becomes the blocker.

Agent owners:

- Manager: status and blocker summary.
- GHL Expert: export and translate current GHL assets.
- Systems Director: downgrade/cancel gates, cost, cron, vendor checks.
- Website/Codex: build the AOH-owned Review Automation and client-page replacement.
- Sender: move Reach sending/drips off GHL later.
- Auditor: verify no secret/customer data is committed.

Next safe action:

Keep the downgrade call focused on what breaks moving to $97. Do not cancel yet. Use GHL for booking, current drips, and low-volume email while AOH-owned Review Automation is tested.

Useful commands:

\`\`\`text
Manager, GHL exit status
GHL Expert, check Reach readiness

The API check is not enough for visual confirmation.

What the API already checks:

- Pipelines exist.
- Cold workflows exist.
- Reply workflows exist.

What still needs a real GHL screen check:

- Sender/from domain matches the lane.
- Dedicated sending domain warmup/status looks safe.
- Workflow email sender nodes use the right sender/from domain.
- Conversation AI, AI Employee, Content AI, Auto-Review Replies, and other HighLevel AI toggles are OFF.

Lane/domain target:

${domainLines.join("\n")}

If Mike personally confirms those screens, use the combined approval so Manager has the confirmation in the same command:

\`\`\`text
approve ${approvalLane} import only; I visually confirmed ${LANES[approvalLane].label} sender domain, warmup status, workflow sender nodes, and HighLevel AI toggles OFF
\`\`\`

Until that visual confirmation is included, import-only remains blocked. Start-drip is still not approved.

Safety:

- No contacts, tags, workflows, settings, or HighLevel AI features were changed.

Agent command center for Mission Control and Slack-ready manager replies.

Examples:
  npm run agent:brief
  npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, status"
  npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, run Reach Cold Email Campaign"
  npm run agent:command -- --command "Manager, GHL exit status"
  npm run agent:command -- --command "GHL Expert, check Reach readiness"
  npm run agent:command -- --command "approve relay import only"
  npm run agent:slack

Options:
  --command "text"          Route a Manager/agent command
  --post-slack              Post result through SLACK_MISSION_CONTROL_WEBHOOK_URL or SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  --record-approval         Update agent-jobs.csv with the approval state
  --record-pause            Update agent-jobs.csv with paused state
  --execute-live            Attempt live approved GHL command; also requires AGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_GHL_ACTIONS=yes
  --out-dir path            Where local command/brief outputs are written

Live safety:
  This script never enables HighLevel AI features.
  This script never imports or starts a drip unless --execute-live is passed, no blockers remain,
  and AGENT_ALLOW_LIVE_GHL_ACTIONS=yes is set for the execution window.
