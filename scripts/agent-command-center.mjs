- GHL Expert API metadata has passed for all three lanes; visual sender/domain/warmup and HighLevel AI OFF checks still remain.
- Default Slack command channel is \`#04-aoh-ops\`.
- Slack webhook posting is ${webhookReady ? "configured" : "not configured in env yet"}; this brief is written locally either way.

Reach queue:

Agent gates before live action:

- Sales Manager: review personal email and duplicate-contact QA flags.
- GHL Expert: visually confirm sender/from domain, warmup status, workflow sender nodes, and HighLevel AI toggles OFF.
- Manager: regenerate/confirm the approval packet for the final CSV.

- Stop at the configured attempt and scrape caps so this cannot loop forever.
- Skip new Outscraper calls unless spend is approved when budget protection is ON.

The API check is not enough for visual confirmation.

What the API already checks:

- Pipelines exist.
- Cold workflows exist.
- Reply workflows exist.

What still needs a real GHL screen check:

- Sender/from domain matches the lane.
- Dedicated sending domain warmup/status looks safe.
- Workflow email sender nodes use the right sender/from domain.
- Conversation AI, AI Employee, Content AI, Auto-Review Replies, and other HighLevel AI toggles are OFF.

Lane/domain target:

If Mike personally confirms those screens, use the combined approval so Manager has the confirmation in the same command:

\`\`\`text
approve ${approvalLane} import only; I visually confirmed ${LANES[approvalLane].label} sender domain, warmup status, workflow sender nodes, and HighLevel AI toggles OFF
