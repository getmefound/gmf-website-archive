      "linkedin-company": `A 5.0 rating is hurting your bookings.

Northwestern's Spiegel Research Center pulled the data: purchase likelihood peaks between 4.6 and 4.8 stars. After 4.8, conversions actually drop. Buyers read perfect ratings as fake, paid, or filtered.

Here's the part most owners miss. A 4.6 with 30 real reviews outconverts a 5.0 with 30 reviews on the exact same search. The shopper sees the 1-star, reads how you handled it, and trusts you more, not less.

So the goal isn't a clean 5.0. The goal is volume, recency, and a couple of imperfect reviews that prove you're real.

That's what we run for clients. Review Automation is $49/mo, no setup fee. We ask every customer at the right moment, route the unhappy ones to you privately, and let the rest flow to Google. Most clients add 8 to 15 reviews in the first 30 days.

      "linkedin-personal": `I tell clients to stop chasing 5.0.

Spent last Tuesday on a call with a dentist who was proud of a perfect rating. 22 reviews, all five stars, newest one from January. I told him his profile reads fake to anyone under 40. He pushed back. So I pulled up a competitor down the road, 4.7 with 180 reviews, newest one yesterday. He was quiet for a second.

Northwestern's research has been clear on this for years. Conversions peak at 4.6 to 4.8. Past that, trust drops. Buyers assume the perfect profile is scrubbed.

We run Review Automation for $49/mo. No setup. It asks at the right moment, filters the angry ones to you privately, and pushes the rest to Google. Clients land in the sweet spot inside a quarter.

Harvard Business School (Luca, 2016): a one-star bump = 5 to 9% revenue lift. Run that backwards. A $480K local business losing 8% of organic discovery to the competitor down the road with fresher reviews = $38,400 walking out the door every year.

That's not theoretical. That's the customer who pulled up two profiles, picked the one with 12 reviews from the last 30 days, and never saw yours.

Most owners don't see this because the loss is invisible. No one calls to say "I picked your competitor because your newest review was from 2023." They just don't call.

ChatGPT, Claude, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity. Roughly 25% of local search volume now happens in answer engines instead of the classic 10-blue-links. The split is higher in high-intent queries: "best dentist near me," "plumber that does emergency repair," "med spa with weekend hours." Those are the queries that close.

Most local businesses have zero strategy for it. Their SEO agency optimized for Google. Their content team optimized for social. Nobody is optimizing for the answer engines that now field a quarter of their highest-value searches.

AI Visibility is $179/mo + $199 setup. We audit what AI currently knows about your business across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. We fix the schema, citations, and structured signals so the answer engines actually pick you. Most clients show up in the top 3 named recommendations inside 60-90 days.

When's the last time you searched your own business in ChatGPT? What did you find?`,
      "linkedin-personal": `I asked a roofer last month how much of his lead flow comes from AI search.

He laughed. "AI? Nobody's using AI to find a roofer."

We checked his Google Search Console. Then we ran the same queries he ranks for through ChatGPT and Perplexity. About 22% of his target query volume now happens in answer engines. He had no presence in any of them. Competitor 3 miles away was named in every single one.

This is the shift nobody is preparing for. Classic SEO still matters, but the share is moving. About 1 in 4 local searches now happens in AI. Those queries skew higher intent. He was invisible in his highest-value channel.

We run AI Visibility for $179/mo + $199 setup. Fixed signals, structured presence, named in answer engines inside 60-90 days for most.

Honest question for the owners reading this: how many marketing software subscriptions are you paying for right now? How many have you logged into this quarter? For most local businesses we onboard, the answer is 4-7 tools, 1-2 logins per quarter.

Here's why. Software dashboards were designed for marketing managers. You don't have a marketing manager. You have a business to run, a phone that rings, a schedule that fills, and 14 things more important than logging into a dashboard.

Done-for-you means zero dashboards. We run the work. You get the result. No login, no setup wizard, no "have you tried our new feature" email.

Whole Stack is $999/mo + $999 setup. Reviews, AI visibility, content, ads, the whole stack handled. Most clients cancel 3-5 software subscriptions inside the first 90 days because they don't need them anymore. Net cost: lower than what they were already paying.

He counted on his fingers. Got to 6. Then remembered a 7th. Total monthly burn: $431 in software he hadn't opened since February. Cumulative since he signed up: $14,000+.

This is the local business tragedy nobody talks about. Software companies sold owners on "automation" and what owners got was a dashboard nobody has time to use. The tools work fine. The work doesn't get done. Different thing.

We pulled his tools, cancelled 5 of them, and rolled him onto Whole Stack at $999/mo + $999 setup. Net monthly: he saved $200 and got reviews, content, ads, and AI visibility actually handled.

A Google review you collect in 2026 is still in your profile in 2036. It's still ranking you. It's still convincing the customer who pulls up your map listing eight years from now. Reviews are a stock. Ads are a flow.

Run the math on a dental practice. 80 reviews collected this year at an average revenue contribution of $400/review (conservative, given lifetime patient value). That's $32,000 of trust-asset created in year one. In year five, those same reviews are still on your profile, still earning. The ROI on review acquisition keeps stacking. The ROI on a Google ad ends the moment the campaign pauses.

Review Automation is $49/mo, no setup. Most clients add 50-80 reviews/year. Treat reviews like a capital investment, not a marketing expense.

Tuesday, 9:47pm. Homeowner has been thinking about Botox for six months. She opens Google. Three med spas in her zip code. Yours first. Star rating is fine, 4.8. But the newest review is from 8 months ago. She hesitates. Backs out. Taps the next one: 4.8, 73 reviews, newest one from last week. She books.

That client just walked. $400 first visit. Filler upgrade at month two: $800. Annual maintenance: $2,000+. Friend referral inside the first quarter: another $400-1,200. Gone in 90 seconds because your newest review was 8 months old.

And it's not one client. It's four. The same missed review costs you the date-forward shopper, the trust-threshold shopper, the story-shaped buyer (looking for "anxious about needles, felt safe here"), and the map-rank slot you lost to a fresher competitor.

The Tuesday-night Botox shopper is high-intent and date-paranoid. She's been thinking about this for months. She wants proof the practice is current, busy, and still doing good work. A 9-month-old newest review reads "closed" to her, even when you're booking out 3 weeks.

Hard threshold. We see it in client funnel data across every groomer we work with. Under 20 reviews and the booking page bounces. The pet parent isn't being picky. She's anxious. She's handing over an animal that can't tell her how the appointment went. She needs proof.

After the 20-review threshold clears, the math shifts. Then it's not how many. It's what they say. Generic 5-star reviews ("great groomer!") don't move the needle. Story-shaped reviews do: "Anxious doodle, first groom, came home calm." "She's nervous about the dryer, they kept it slow." Those convert.

Timing is the other lever. The pickup-moment ask (right when the dog walks out happy) converts at 30-50%. The 2-day-later text converts at 5-10%. Six-times difference for ten seconds of timing work.

Review Automation is $49/mo, no setup. We ask at the pickup moment, prompt for story details, filter unhappy reviews to you privately. Most groomers hit the 20-review threshold inside 60 days.

She couldn't figure out why her website traffic wasn't converting. I told her: pet parents don't book under 20 reviews. It's a hard threshold. Then I asked her when she asks for reviews. "Two days after, by text." Of course. 5-10% conversion on that text. That's why she had 14 reviews after 18 months.

The pickup moment is everything. The dog walks out, the parent is relieved and grateful, the bond is fresh. Ask there and you're at 30-50%. Ask two days later and you're at 5-10%. Same business, six-times the result, ten seconds of difference.
