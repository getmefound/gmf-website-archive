  {
    q: "How is GetMeFound different from other agencies?",
    a: "No contract, cancel anytime. We give you a free report before you pay a single dollar. We have to earn your trust before we ask for anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will automated replies sound fake and hurt me with Google?",
    a: "Generic, templated responses can make a business look careless. Get Chosen includes AI-drafted replies in your business voice, but they start approval-first. Sensitive reviews always stay human-reviewed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much of my time does this take?",
    a: "Get Found needs a short onboarding call and access details. After that, the monthly plans are built to be light: send or upload customer lists, approve anything risky, and read the recap.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see results?",
    a: "Review requests start going out within 48 hours of setup. Most clients see new reviews within the first two weeks. Google ranking improvements typically take 60-90 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AI Visibility just regular SEO with a new name?",
    a: "Different mechanism entirely. Traditional SEO gets you a spot on Google's list of links. AI Visibility gets your business recommended by name when someone asks ChatGPT who's the best plumber near me - that's a recommendation, not a ranking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I need to keep paying monthly?",
    a: "ChatGPT and Claude constantly retrain. Google's algorithm keeps changing. Review velocity matters - a business that stops getting reviews looks inactive to both customers and algorithms. Your monthly fee keeps you active, monitored, and found.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I get a bad review?",
    a: "A professional, calm reply in your voice does more for your reputation than ignoring it. Get Chosen drafts suggested responses and flags sensitive issues before anything is posted.",
  },
  {
    q: "You're a new company - why should I trust you?",
    a: "We're new and we know it. That's exactly why we don't lock you into contracts, we give you a free audit before you pay anything, and we're transparent about our pricing. We have to earn your business - and we plan to.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will this hurt my existing Google Business Profile?",
    a: "No. We work within Google's guidelines — optimizing what's already there, not replacing it. We never delete reviews, alter your category without approval, or make changes that could trigger a suspension. Everything we touch gets your sign-off first.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I cancel?",
    a: "Email us anytime. No cancellation fee, no questions beyond what we need to wrap up your account cleanly. Monthly plans stop at the end of your current billing cycle. We don't make cancellation hard.",
  },
