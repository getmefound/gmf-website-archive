${B_WHO_FOR}
Operators who'd rather be in the truck, the chair, or the operatory than in a marketing dashboard.

${B_WHO_FOR}
Service-business owners who've been ignoring "the AI thing" because it felt like too much to figure out. We figure it out for you.

That's the promise at AI Outsource Hub. My job is making sure your first 30 days actually feel that way — handled, not figured out.

${B_WHAT_I_DO}
I run sales and onboarding at AOH. When you sign with us, I'm the one you talk to. I gather what we need, set up your services, and get your AI live — usually inside a week. You won't chase me. I'll already have messaged you.

${B_HOW}
Six done-for-you services from $49/month. No 40-page onboarding doc. No "log into our portal and click through these 12 steps." We do the setup. You see the results.

Owners who are tired of being sold tools they never use. We're the opposite of that.
